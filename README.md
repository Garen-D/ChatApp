# ChatApp

This app is a demo using ReactJS, Auth0, and Pusher to create a chat app.

## How to run this app

1. Clone the repo - `https://github.com/Mrkeybird/ChatApp.git`
2. Open `src/Auth/auth0-variables.js`, `server.js` and `src/Chat/Chat.js`and edit with your Auth0 and Pusher credentials which can be gotten from the [Pusher dashboard](https://pusher.com).
If you do not have those credentials, then logging in with a Google account will work also. If you choose this method, do not change any code.
3. In the root of the project folder, run `yarn` to install all dependencies. If you encounter an error, also run `yarn` in the 'react-pusher' folder
4. Then run `yarn start` in the 'react-pusher' folder to get the app up and running.
